In the current era of digitalization, a lot of data can be accessed easily by the public through a technology, this has a positive impact on every data actor or practitioner, especially in data mining where they can get a wide range of dataset sources to perform an activity. Web mining or commonly referred to as the web scraping method is one way that can be done to get data sources from the internet, especially on data contained on a website.

In the scraping process that will be carried out this time is web scraping using Beautifulsoup and Selenium on one of the property buying and selling websites, lamudi.co.id. Then the data to be taken is the selling price data for apartments located in DKI Jakarta. The features of the data to be retrieved are:

1) Title        : this data contains apartment names.
2) Location     : this data contains information about the location of the apartments for sale.
3) Description  : this data contains a lot of information about apartments for sale, ranging from public and private facilities available in apartments to public places closest to the apartment.
4) Price        : this data contains information about the selling price of the apartment.
5) Rooms        : this data contains information related to the area of the room, the number of bedrooms and the number of bathrooms in the apartment.
6) Owner        : this data contains the name of the owner of the apartment being sold.

However, the resulting dataset from web scraping is still in the form of raw data, which needs to be cleaned first if the dataset is to be used in the further analysis process.
